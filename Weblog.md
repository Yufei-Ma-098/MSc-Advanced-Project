## September Achievements
### Week 1: Experimentation and Prototyping
#### Exploring Diverse Components
- Initiated the project by experimenting with a variety of materials and interactive components. The goal was to identify the most effective mediums that could bring our interactive installation to life.
- Tested different types of air pumps and sensors to understand their capabilities and limitations in the context of our interactive design.
#### Decision on Air Pump and Valve Module
After evaluating multiple options, decided to use an integrated air pump and valve module. This module was chosen for its efficiency and compact design, making it ideal for our installation.
- Features of the Selected Module:
  - Three-Way Adapter: Facilitates the seamless transition between inflating and deflating, crucial for the dynamic interaction we envisioned.
  - Inflation and Deflation Buttons: These tactile buttons provide users with straightforward and intuitive control over the air flow, enhancing the interactive experience.
  - Compact and Robust Design: The module's small footprint allowed for easy integration into the installation without compromising on the aesthetic and functional aspects.
#### Selecting the Tubing
Chose specific tubing dimensions to ensure optimal airflow and installation design.
Tube Specifications:
- Length: 500mm - This length was ideal to connect the air pump module to the balloons while maintaining the installation's design integrity.
- Inner Diameter: 3mm - Sufficient to provide adequate airflow for inflation and deflation, while ensuring quick response to user interactions.
- Outer Diameter: 5mm - Provided the necessary durability and flexibility for the installation setup.
#### Balloon Integration
Selected balloons that could withstand repeated inflation and deflation cycles without losing elasticity or integrity.
Balloons were also chosen based on their visual impact and how well they resonated with the thematic elements of the installation.
#### Power Supply Considerations
Opted for a reliable and consistent power supply to ensure the smooth operation of the air pumps and control system.
Ensured that the power supply was capable of handling the installation's overall energy requirements, including the air pumps, control systems, and any additional lighting or sensory elements.


### Week 2: Development and Coding
- Dedicated this week to developing the code for interactive elements. My aim was to create an engaging user experience that would resonate with users at an emotional level. This involved writing scripts in Arduino IDE, ensuring smooth communication between the hardware components and the interactive interface.

### Week 3: Concept Testing and Refinement
- Conducted several low-fidelity tests to refine the concept and ensure both technical feasibility and user engagement. These tests revealed valuable insights into how users interacted with the installation, guiding me to make iterative improvements to the prototype.

  
### Week 4: Finalizing the Concept
- After receiving comprehensive feedback, I finalized the overarching theme and concept for the installation. During the process, I faced a significant challenge: the cage, initially assembled with tube connectors, was not stable and would easily come apart under the pressure from the inflated balloons. This led me to spend two days exploring options at a local building materials market, where I eventually decided to switch to using wires for a more robust construction.
- I started detailed planning for the final construction and implementation of the installation, considering this new approach.


## October Development
### Week 1: Realizing the Vision
- Completed the first working demo of the interactive installation, showcasing its core features and interactive capabilities. During this phase, I encountered another hurdle: the initially purchased 0.4mm diameter wire was too thin and would bend out of shape under the pressure from the balloons. This prompted another visit to the building materials market, where I opted for a sturdier 1mm diameter wire, offering the necessary strength and stability.

### Week 2: Academic Insights
- Initiated drafting of the academic paper to document the theoretical underpinnings, design process, and technical details of the project.

### Week 3: User Engagement and Feedback
- Conducted extensive user testing sessions, and observed user interaction.
- Analyzed user interactions, refining the installation based on observed patterns and responses.

### Week 4: Thesis Advancement
- Continued developing the thesis, focusing on aligning the practical work with academic theories and context.

  
## November Activities
### Week 1: Finalizing Documentation
- Dedicated efforts towards finalizing the academic paper and preparing for submission.
- Began the production of a video demonstration, aiming to capture the essence and impact of the interactive installation.

### Week 2: Capturing the Experience
- Filmed the interactive installation in action, focusing on highlighting user interactions, emotional responses, and the overall impact.
